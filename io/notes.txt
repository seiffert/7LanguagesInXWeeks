- Strongly/Weakly typed? 

        Io> 1 + 1
        ==> 2
        Io> 1 slotNames
        ==> list()
        Io> 1 + "one"

          Exception: argument 0 to method '+' must be a Number, not a 'Sequence'
          ---------
          message '+' in 'Command Line' on line 1

    -> looks like it is strongly typed: it does not convert types implicitly

- Is 0 true or false?
    All numbers are considered true when used as a boolean expression
- Is the empty string true or false?
    -> true
- Is nil true or false?
    -> false

- How can you tell what slots a prototype supports?
    -> By sending it the slotNames message
       <prototype> slotNames

- =   Assigns a value to an already existing slot
- :=  Assigns a value to a not yet existing slot
- ::= Assigns a value to a not yet existing slot, creates a setter
